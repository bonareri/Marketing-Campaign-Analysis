# 📊 Paid Search Campaign Performance Analysis

## 🛍️ Project Overview  
As a **data analyst**, I undertook the **Paid Search Campaign Performance Analysis** project to evaluate the effectiveness of a **5-month paid search campaign** for a shopping mall. The goal was to determine whether the paid ads were driving meaningful engagement and conversions. Using **Power BI**, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze **clicks, impressions, CTR, conversion rates, and revenue performance**.  

Through data-driven insights, I identified which ad groups performed best, how spending aligned with revenue, and areas where optimizations were needed. The results guided the marketing team in making informed decisions to improve ad efficiency and return on investment (ROI).
