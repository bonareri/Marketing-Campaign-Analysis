# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis  

## Project Overview  
Understanding the effectiveness of paid search campaigns is crucial for optimizing marketing budgets and maximizing returns. This project analyzes a **5-month paid search campaign** for a shopping mall to determine whether ad spend translated into meaningful engagement and conversions.
